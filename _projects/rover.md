We designed a low-detail Mars Perseverance/Curiosity–style rover in SolidWorks and used it to benchmark mobility performance in ADAMS simulations. The rover was tested on uneven terrain under Mars-gravity conditions, allowing us to analyze the passive dynamics of the [rocker-bogie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocker-bogie) suspension with wheel-only actuation. Through this project, we gained insight into how the suspension design maintains stability and traction over rough surfaces—capabilities that are essential for planetary exploration rovers.
