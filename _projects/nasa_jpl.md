## Mars Perseverance Rover

At the [NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/), I worked with a team of mobility engineers and flight technicians to build the rover mobility system, stress test its sub-assemblies, and integrate it onto the rover’s chassis in a cleanroom in preparation for flight.

A mobility engineer and I led a group of flight technicians and built a variable center of gravity fixture. The variable center of gravity fixture (pink) was used to facilitate  handling of the Mars Perseverance Rover mobility subsystem. A photo was taken from the Spacecraft Assembly Facility (SAF) viewing window during an application of the fixture.

<!-- Testing -->
I led the stress testing effort on a part of the mobility subassembly along with some testing of mobility capabilities via the Scarecrow Rover.

## Robosimian Robot

The RoboSimian robot has different modes of locomotion. The robot’s mobility was hindered by it’s old cantilevered wheel design. Components of the old wheel assembly design repeatedly snagged on jagged terrain. I designed a new ”fork” style wheel assembly to avoid the snagging that impedes the robot’s mobility.
