This trophy was fabricated for Caltech’s ME 13: Introduction to Mechanical Prototyping course, and I completed it during my research internship at Caltech. The aluminum base was machined on a vertical mill, the acrylic label was laser-cut, and the brass shaft was turned on a manual lathe. The gear platform was sandblasted and cut using a water-jet cutter, and the “MCE” logo was printed on a 3D printer.
