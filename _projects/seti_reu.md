## Extracting Water from the Martian Atmosphere

At the [Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) Institute](https://www.seti.org/), I collaborated with planetary scientist [Dr. Pascal Lee](http://www.pascallee.net/bio/) on assessing the feasibility of atmospheric water extraction on Mars as a potential ISRU strategy for future human exploration. I presented the results at multiple venues, including an abstract and poster at the 49th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (LPSC), a Lightning Talk at the SETI Institute, and a presentation at Cal Poly Pomona’s Summer Research Symposium.
